Here in the python script I have defined a Bus_Booking class.
Each class of the object is a particular bus with a fixed capacity, which will be given as a variable while the buss object creation.
User can book their sit, they can provide their seat preference. 
After booking they willl get a particular id and seat number based on thir name and booking number
They can also cancel their seat and will also get a conformation
They can also check their seat status
For each of the above work the classs have different methods which the usser have to call as per their requirements.
